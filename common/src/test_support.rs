//! Cross-crate test fixtures for `common`'s domain types, gated by the
//! `test-support` feature (mirroring `storage::test_support`, ADR-0033): `common`'s
//! own tests reach it under `cfg(test)`; `storage`, `server`, and `web` reach it via
//! the `test-support` feature. Kept out of shipped binaries.

// Test scaffolding that deliberately `expect()`s on a fixture parse, so the
// workspace's `expect_used = deny` lint is expected off for this module; `#[expect]`
// self-flags if the scaffolding ever stops using `expect`.
